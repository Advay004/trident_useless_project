### Project Description
Seat & Swap is designed to shake up the usual friend groups on campus! With a single click, students can swap seats and experience new conversations, meet new people, and strengthen campus connections

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt like everyone is sticking with the same crowd? It‚Äôs too easy to miss out on meeting new people, experiencing diverse perspectives, and appreciating the different cultures on campus.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Seat Swap helps people break out of their comfort zones by facilitating random, fun seat swaps, leading to new friendships and stronger community bonds, all while promoting inclusivity and diversity in a lighthearted way.
